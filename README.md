# PokemonCardSorter
# This one requires some explaining
# I found a tin full of old pokemon cards and I wanted to put them inside a 3x3 binder
# Every pokemon is normally represented by a number and I wanted to put my cards in numarical order with empty spaces left for the creatures I didn't have
# You input the pokemon's number and the program tells you where in the binder to put that card
